4.7
the baseline of rsden
done:
training baseline
need:
resolution problem
now is the bilinear method to get the final estimation this is not sensibale
we need to remove the deconvolutional layer in the network 
or use the super resolution method
4.10
load resnet
determine the depth space
4.11
depth space
done with nyu1 train, waiting for the baseline result
need:
loss only on the measured area
the nyu1 all get ground
the introduction of nips
the region support ground truth
adding the region support for the baseline
design the region support network
combine the two network
4.25
stop train baseline
reproduce data with semantic and train the baseline again
form the final baseline and method
without semantic 
with semantic 
produce region support
with region support
with leanring region support
done
